      <description>For our AI lab at ZHAW, we were tasked with programming a heuristic agent for the game 2048. In this post, I will document my approach and what I learned.
Initial Approach: Heuristics for Improved Play Finding the right heuristics Our first goal was to design heuristics and an algorithm that could outperform a random-move agent. I started by implementing two key heuristics:
 Number of Empty Tiles: This metric represents the number of available moves on the board, with more empty tiles indicating more possible actions.</description>

      <description>My name is Zaccaria and I&amp;rsquo;m a computer science student at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). Here, I share exciting projects that I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working on during my studies and in my free time. While I&amp;rsquo;ve just started with this blog, there might not be a lot of stuff here just yet. However, I appreciate you stopping by and taking a look :)
Interests I&amp;rsquo;m interested in AI and data science because they help us dive into our own minds and make sense of the world around us.</description>
