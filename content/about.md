My name is Zaccaria and I'm a computer science student at Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW).
Here, I share exciting projects that I've had the pleasure of working on during my studies and in my free time.
While I've just started with this blog, there might not be a lot of stuff here just yet. However, I appreciate you stopping by and taking a look :)
### Interests
I'm interested in AI and data science because they help us dive into our own minds and make sense of the world around us. In my free time, I like to read books and hike in nature. I also really like birds, especially flightless ones.
### Skills
- Python, Java, C
- Linux, Docker
- LaTeX
